# Machine-Learning-Initial-tests

Two Machine Learning tests.

```
Hello_world: is a beginners guide to ML, trying to identify apples to oranges.
 - oranges are heavier and have a bumpy texture
 - apples are lighter and have a smooth texture.

 We then use this data in a set of arrays.

 This is then ran through the sklearn library's machine learning algorithm of the   DecisionTreeClassifier and predicts whether the array we supply is an apple or orange.
```

```
 Iris-Challenge: uses the Iris flower database, which happens to also be contained in the sklearn library, and gets us to identify whether the arrays supplied are an Iris flower or not.

 We use three varying methods of machine learning from the sklearn library to produce an outcome percentage.
